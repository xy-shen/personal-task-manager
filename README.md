## Key Features Explained

### State Management
Uses React Context API with useReducer for predictable state updates:
- Actions: ADD_TASK, UPDATE_TASK, DELETE_TASK, TOGGLE_STATUS
- Immutable state updates
- Type-safe operations

### Routing
Implements client-side routing with React Router:
- `/` - Task list view
- `/add` - Add new task form
- `/task/:id` - Individual task details

### TypeScript Integration
- Strongly typed components and props
- Interface definitions for all data structures
- Type-safe state management

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interfaces
